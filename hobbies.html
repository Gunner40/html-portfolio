  <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Golf. I am a 4 handicap golfer, on a good day :-)</li>
    <li>
      Soccer. I love watching soccer and I am a lifelong fan of Arsenal FC.
    </li>
    <li>
      GAA. Being a Wicklow man I don't have much to shout about :-( but I love
      the game. I used to play as a forward for my local team, Valleymount GAA,
      and won the Junior A championship in 1998 and the Div 3 league in 2004.

      I love socialising and going for a few pints and a chat with my friends.
